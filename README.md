## Hi there 👋

I’m Aleksandra — an MA student exploring the crossroads of **cultural data** and **AI**.  
Right now I’m building small, curious projects to understand how people talk, create, and react online.

- 🎓 Studying: Cultural Data & AI (MA)
- 🐍 Tools I enjoy: Python, Jupyter, pandas, matplotlib
- 🧠 Interests: cultural analytics, digital humanities, media ecosystems, algorithmic bias
- 🧪 Current experiments: news attention timelines, social media discourse, tiny NLP models
- 🌱 Learning more about: NLP, data visualization, and “explainable” AI for culture

I like projects that start with a simple question like  
> “How are people talking about this right now?”  
and then grow into notebooks full of messy data, visualizations, and little surprises.

If you’re into cultural analytics, digital humanities, or just like poking at text data for fun,  
feel free to reach out or peek into my repos — everything here is a work in progress on purpose. ✨
